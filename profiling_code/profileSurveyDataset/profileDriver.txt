The Following is the Survey With Hive
Note. I decided to run each command individually rather than
write a script since it was just overall easier and more
mallable to work with.

# Creates the initial table
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE hiveSurveydata(wellbeing INT, productivity INT, boredom INT, officesetup INT, officeCommunication INT, loneliness INT, age INT, gender INT) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LOCATION '/user/emb689/ana_code/etl_results';

# Populates the table with the concat. results from ALL boroughs
load data inpath 'hdfs://horton.hpc.nyu.edu:8020/user/emb689/ana_code/etl_results/cleanSurveyResults/cleanSurveyData.csv' into table hiveSurveydata;

# Gets the number of rows
select count(*) as totalRecords from hiveSurveydata;

# Gets the Avg for each
select 
ROUND(avg(wellbeing), 2) as AvgWellBeing, 
ROUND(avg(productivity), 2) as AvgProductivity,
ROUND(avg(boredom), 2) as AvgBoredom,
ROUND(avg(officesetup), 2) as AvgOfficeSetup,
ROUND(avg(officeCommunication), 2) as AvgOfficeCommunication,
ROUND(avg(loneliness), 2) as AvgLoneliness,
ROUND(avg(age), 2) as AvgAge
from hiveSurveyData;
